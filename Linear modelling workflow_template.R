# 1. Source the support file for this routine ----
#-##############################################-#
rm(list = ls()) # OPTIONAL: Execute to remove previous objects from the global environment.

# Activate the support 'functions file' for this routine:
source("Linear modelling workflow_support functions.R") 
  # NOTE-1: The 'functions file' must be located in your current working directory.
  # NOTE-2: At first use, all missing packages required for this routine are automatically installed.
  # NOTE-3: "Step plot settings" in the functions file specifies the ggplot2 theme for the entire routine. 
  #         Modify there as needed, leave it as default otherwise.

# 2. Import the dataframe  ----
#-###########################-#
# Headers of this template match the respective section headers of the accompanying article. 
# Consult the article for more detailed explanations of each section. 

# Import data frame (example only. Any other import function of R can be used).
df <- read.table(file = "myfile.csv",      # Replace "myfile.csv" with your data file name.
                 header = T,               # Specify whether first row contains variable names.
                 sep = ",")                # Specify the field separator character in the data.

# Carefully check data structure, column names and vector classes. Change them as needed.
str(df)


#-##############################-#
# 3. Definition of variables  ----
#-##############################-#
# In step 3.1 through 3.4, the names of all variables (= data frame columns) that are potentially relevant 
# for your analysis are stored as STRINGS for further use:
#================================#
# * 3.1 ONE RESPONSE variable ----
#================================#
var_resp <- "response"                     # Replace with the name of the response variable.


#=============================================================================#
# * 3.2 Fixed predictors: quantitative and categorical predictor variables ----
#=============================================================================#
# FACTOR PREDICTOR variable(s)
var_fac <- NA                              # assign default NA if missing.
  # var_fac <- c("fac_1", "fac_2", ... )   # Template: replace entries with the name(s) of your factor predictor(s).
                                           # Assure all these are factors with at least two levels.

# NUMERIC or INTEGER PREDICTOR variable(s) 
var_num <- NA                              # assign default NA if missing.
  # var_num <- c("num_1", "num_2", ... )   # Template: replace entries with the name(s) of your numeric predictor(s).
                                           # Assure all these are numeric or integer.

#==============================================================#
# * 3.3 Random predictors: dependency structure of the data ----
#==============================================================#
# RANDOM term(s)
var_rand <- NA                             # assign default NA if missing.
  # var_rand <- c("rand_1", "rand_2", ...) # Template: replace entries with the name(s) of your factor random term(s).
                                           # Assure all these are factors with at least five levels.

#==============================================#
# * 3.4 Temporal and spatial data structure ----
#==============================================#
# The variables specified here will be used to check for temporal and/or spatial autocorrelation in model residuals (6.3).

# NUMERIC or INTEGER TIME variable that specifies temporal structure.
  # First, enter ONE variable that has information on temporal sequence/time:
  var_time <- NA                          # assign default NA if missing.
    # var_time <- "daytime"               # Template: replace entry with the name of your temporal variable.
  
  # Second, if these temporal data are structured, add the grouping variable below.
  # (example: multiple parallel time-series that are split by experimental blocks)
  var_time_groups <- NA                   # assign NA if missing.
    # var_time_groups <- "daytime.grouping" # Template: replace entry with the name of your temporal grouping variable.

# NUMERIC or INTEGER COORDINATES (x, y) that specify spatial structure.
  var_space <- NA                         # assign NA if missing.
    # var_space <- c("x_coord","y_coord") # Template: replace entry with the name of your variables that contain spatial coordinates.

  
#=========================#
# * 3.5 Missing values ----
#=========================#
# We prune the dataset to complete cases for all variables that are considered for analysis.
df.pr <- remove_NAs(data = df, variables = c(var_num, var_fac, var_rand, var_resp))
  # NOTE-1: Data pruning should be kept to the minimum needed to allow models to run. 
  #         Therefore, rerun 1. after a final model formulation has been identified. This may allow to rescue some observations.
  # NOTE-2: A key assumption is that missing data (and the reasons for data to be missing) are randomly distributed across the dataset. 
  #         Confirm by inspecting the removed data rows after creating the dataset df.NAs 
            df.NAs <- anti_join(df,  df.pr) # This object contains all removed data rows.
  
# Keep only complete cases in the dataset for further analysis: 
df <- df.pr


#-###############################-#
# 4. Raw data exploration ----
#-###############################-#
# This step helps to identify patterns that may require consideration for model formulation.
# NOTE: Further checks can be found in the residual plot analysis (section 6.1), in particular for missing predictors or interactions.

#=========================#
# * 4.1 Extreme values ----
#=========================#
# We graphically inspect variables for extreme values.

#---------------------------------------------#
# ** 4.1.1 Extremes in NUMERICAL variables ---- 
#---------------------------------------------#
dotplot_num(data = df, variables = c(var_num, var_resp)) # Dotplots for all numerical predictors plus the response variable.

# What should I look for?
# >> Is any observation CLEARLY separated from the core distribution? Such observersation may represent 'implausible extremes'

# Resolving implausible extreme values: 
# >> Check where such values originate from. If you can trace them to objective (!) typing errors, correct these values.
# >> If extremes are in the response variable: choose an adequate distribution family.
# >> If extremes are in predictor variables: 
#    1. Use model assessment to check if these predictor values cause concern.
#    2. If so, consider data transformation to mitigate the issue.
# >> If extremes cannot be modeled appropriately, consider reporting effect estimates and their SE with and without these extremes.


#------------------------------------------#  
# ** 4.1.2 Extremes in FACTOR variables ----      
#------------------------------------------#
barplot_fac(data = df, variables = c(var_fac, var_rand)) # Barplots for all factor predictors and random terms.

# What should I look for?
# >> Are observations roughly balanced between grouping levels (conforming to a "balanced design")?

# Resolving extreme unbalance: 
# >> If some factor levels arise from typing errors: Correct them.
# >> If there is extreme imbalance in sample size among factor levels, 
#    accept that effect estimates for those with poor replication will associate with large uncertainty.
#    Alternatively, consider pooling levels with very few replicates, but only if this remains biologically meaningful. 

  
#================================#
# * 4.2 Predictor collinearity ----
#================================#
# We graphically and numerically inspect variables for predictor collinearity.

#-------------------------------------------------------------#
# ** 4.2.1: Graphical inspection for predictor collinearity ----
#-------------------------------------------------------------#
# We graphically inspect predictor collinearity for all pairwise combinations of numeric and/or factor predictors.

# *** 4.2.1.1: NUMERIC predictors: Scatterplots ----
# Skip this step if you have < 2 numeric predictors
coll_num(data = df, predictors = var_num) # Pairwise scatterplots for all numeric predictors.
# What should I look for?
# >> Data should distribute rather homogeneously.


# *** 4.2.1.2: FACTOR against NUMERIC predictors: Swarm plots ----
# Skip this step if your predictors are either all numeric, OR all factor.
coll_num_fac(data = df, predictors = c(var_num, var_fac))  # Swarm boxplots for all numeric against all factor predictors.
# What should I look for?
# >> Numeric values on the y axis should distribute roughly homogeneously across levels on the x-axis.
 

# *** 4.2.1.3: FACTOR predictors: Mosaic plots ----   
# Skip this step if you have < 2 factor predictors.
coll_fac(data = df, predictors = var_fac)  # Pairwise mosaic plots for all factor predictors.
# What should I look for?
# >> All combinations of predictor levels should have roughly similar sample sizes.


#------------------------------------------------#
# ** 4.2.2: Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs) ----
#------------------------------------------------#
corvif(data = df, variables = c(var_num, var_fac))  # VIF are calculated for all fixed predictors potentially included in the model.
# Derived from Zuur, Ieno & Elphick (2010).

# What should I look for?
# >> Check column "GVIF": Entirely independent predictors yield GVIF = 1, while larger GVIF values indicate 
#   increasing predictor collinearity (see article section 4.2.2 for details)


#==========================================#
#* 4.3 Predictor-response relationships ----
#==========================================#
# The function generates plots of the response variable against each of the potential predictor variables.
relat_single(data = df,
             response = var_resp,                        # Name of response variable
             # y.limits = c(min,max),                    # (optional) - Limits of the y-axis. Replace min and max with your limits
             # y.breaks = c(value_1,value_2,value_3,...),# (optional) - Breaks of the y-axis. Replace with your values
             predictors = c(var_num, var_fac)            # Name of fixed predictors
             )  
# NOTE: Up to 9 plots are shown in the plot window... 
#       If > 9 plots are present, they are saved in your working directory in a file 
#       named "Predictor_response_relationships.pdf"

# What should I look for?
# >> Identify relevant relationships with the response.


#===============================#
# * 4.4 Response distribution ----
#===============================#
# Visualise the distribution of your response variable.
distr_response(data = df, response = var_resp) 
  # What should I look for?
  # >> The observed distribution of the response confirms - at least roughly - your initial expectation.
  #    If not, adjust the distribution family for your initial model accordingly. 


#-#######################-#
# 5. Model formulation ----
#-#######################-#
# Based on the conclusions from data exploration, formulate your preliminary model.

#===============================================#
# * 5.1 Standardisation of numeric predictors ----
#===============================================#
# This step is optional, but standardisation is recommended.
# The code adds z-transformed numeric covariates to the dataframe. We recommend to use these for model formulation.
df <- cbind(df, z_transform(data = df,         # z-transformation ...
                        predictors = var_num)) # ... for all numeric predictor variables.

    # Users who have already standardised their predictors have two options:
    # 1. Skip this step. and accept that final results plots will display standardised predictor values.
    # 2. Start with predictors on the raw scale, and use our function for scaling to allow correct final plotting.


#===============================#
# * 5.2 Model implementation ----
#===============================#

#---------------------------------------#  
# ** 5.2.1 Initial model formulation ----
#---------------------------------------#  
# Implement the initial model.
# See article section 5.2 for guidance to model formulation.
mod <- glmmTMB(response ~ pred.1 + pred.2,         # Template: Replace with your complete model formula.
               data = df,                          # Name of dataframe.
               family = poisson(link = "log"))     # Template: Replace with your distribution family and link.

# This formulation may need refinement (section 5.2.2 in manuscript) after model assessment (6.).


#-######################-#
# 6. Model assessment ----  
#-######################-#

# Before inspecting model results, careful assessment is required.

#========================#
#* 6.1 Residual checks ----
#========================#
# This step helps with checking for 'residual patterns'.

#-----------------------------------------#
# ** 6.1.1: Distribution of residuals -----
#-----------------------------------------#
# This function plots the overall distribution of model residuals.
residual_plots(data = df,
               modelTMB = mod,
               response = var_resp) # Name of response variable.

# What should I look for? 
# >> QQ-plot for residuals: Points should closely follow the diagonal reference line.
# >> Residuals against fitted: Points should homogeneously scatter without any pattern.
# >> QQ-plot for random intercepts, ONLY produced for (G)LMMs: Points should closely follow the diagonal reference line.

# Resolving violations:
# >> Seek a distribution family and/or a link function that better capture the observed residual distribution.
# >> The model may lack an important covariate (-> 6.1.2), or an informative interaction term (-> 6.1.3).
# >> The model may lack relevant non-linear (polynomial) terms (-> 6.1.2).
# >> The model could be over- or underdispersed (-> 6.2.1).
# >> The model may suffer from zero-inflation (-> 6.2.2).


#---------------------------------------------------#
# ** 6.1.2: Residuals against possible PREDICTORS ----
#---------------------------------------------------#
# This function plots residuals against all possible predictors specified in 1.
residual_plots_predictors(data = df,
                          modelTMB = mod,
                          predictors = c(var_num, var_fac)) # Name of all fixed predictors in the dataframe.
# NOTE: For this check, we recommend that var_num and var_fac ALSO contain available variable(s) 
# that are currently NOT part of the model. 

# What should I look for? 
# >> Points should homogeneously scatter without obvious pattern.

# Resolving violations:
# >> Seek a distribution family and/or link function that better capture the observed residual distribution.
# >> The model may lack an important covariate (shown here: covariates that show residual patterns).
#    or an informative interaction term (-> 6.1.3).
# >> The model may lack relevant non-linear (polynomial) terms (shown here: curvilinear patterns in residuals across a given covariate).
# >> The model could be over- or underdispersed (-> 6.2.1).
# >> The model may suffer from zero-inflation (-> 6.2.2).
# >> Add a dispersion formula to the model to explicitly integrate heterogeneous variance across predictor values / levels.


#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#  
# ** 6.1.3: Residuals against possible TWO-WAY INTERACTIONS AMONG PREDICTORS ----
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#  
# Graphical displays of all 2-way predictor-response relationships.
residual_plots_interactions(data = df, 
                            modelTMB = mod, 
                            predictors = c(var_num, var_fac))      # All fixed predictors in the dataframe.
# NOTE-1: In numeric vs. numeric display panels, smoothing lines are added as a visual aid to detect non-linear relationships.
# NOTE-2: Up to 9 plots are shown in the plot window. 
#         If > 9 plots are present, they are saved in your working directory as "Two-ways_interactions.pdf".

# What should I look for?   
# >> Points should homogeneously scatter without obvious pattern. 

# Resolving violations:
# >> Consider adding the relevant interaction term to the model if meaningful. 


#------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# ** 6.1.4: Residuals against PREDICTORS split by RANDOM FACTOR LEVELS ----
#------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# These plots can reveal if any random intercept term additionally needs random slopes over a specific fixed predictor.
  # NOTE: ONLY useful when MULTIPLE observations per combination of random and factor levels are present.
  #       Please only select those var_fac, var_num and/or var_rand that meet this criterion.
residual_plots_random_slopes(data = df,                       # Name of dataframe.
                             modelTMB = mod,                  # Name of model.
                             fixed_eff = c(var_num, var_fac), # Name of fixed factors meeting criterion described above.
                             random_eff = var_rand)           # Name of random factors meeting criterion described above.

# What should I look for?
# >> Do plot panels indicate diverging slopes (for numeric predictors),
#    or inconsistent effect directions (for factor predictors)?

# What if this is the case? 
# >> Add a random slope for that specific predictor to the model (see article section 5.2.1)


#=====================================#
# * 6.2 Posterior predictive checks ----
#=====================================# 
# Assess model performance with posterior predictive checks.
# These compare the observed data with the distribution of many, ideally >2000, 
# replicate raw dataframes simulated from the model. For initial checks a lower number of n.sim will do, though.

#-----------------------#
# ** 6.2.1 Dispersion ----
#-----------------------#
# Compare the variance of the observed data with the variance distribution in model-simulated dataframes:
dispersion_simulation(data = df, 
                      modelTMB = mod,
                      response = var_resp,
                      # predictor = var_fac[1], # (optional, but recommended) - A SINGLE factor predictor to split this plot. Use a different index number as needed.
                      n.sim = 500)            # Number of simulations. Set to >2000 for final model assessment.

# What should I look for?
# >> Observed variance should be roughly central within the simulated distributions.
# >> Check the function's feedback messages in the R console window.

# Resolving violations:
# >> Check if dispersion issues are connected to zero inflation (-> 6.2.2).
# >> Look for a distribution family and link that better capture the observed data dispersion.

#---------------------------#
# ** 6.2.2 Zero inflation ---- 
#---------------------------#
# The function compares the observed number of zeros to the zero-distribution in model-simulated datasets. 
zero_simulation(data = df, 
                modelTMB = mod,
                response = var_resp,
                # predictor = var_fac[1], # (optional, but recommended) - A SINGLE factor predictor to split plots by levels.
                n.sim = 500)              # Number of simulations, set to >2000 for final model assessment.

# What should I look for?
# >> Observed zero values should be roughly central within the simulated distributions.
# >> Check the function's feedback messages in the R console window.

# Resolving violations:
# >> Look for a distribution family and/or link function that better capture your observed zero frequencies.
# >> Add a zero-inflation term to your refined model (see article section 5.2.2).  


#-------------------------------#
# ** 6.2.3 Data distribution ----
#-------------------------------# 
# The function compares the observed raw data distribution with that observed in model-simulated dataframes.
ppcheck_fun(data = df,
            modelTMB = mod,
            response = var_resp,
            # predictor = var_fac[1],   # (optional, but recommended) - A SINGLE factor predictor to split this plot.
            n.sim = 500)                # Number of simulations, set to >2000 for final model assessment.

# What should I look for?
# >> Ideally, the observed data distribution should be roughly central within the pattern 
#    of simulated data from the model.

# Resolving violations:
# >> Carefully re-evaluate the preceding steps of model assessment, and reformulate your model.


#=================================#
# * 6.3 Autocorrelation checks ---- 
#=================================#
# We check for spatial and temporal correlation patterns in model residuals (= autocorrelation) 
# using standardised semivariograms.
autocor_check(data = df, 
              modelTMB = mod,
              variable = var_time,       # Checking for TIME? => use var_time  | Checking for SPACE? => use var_space.
              # grouping = var_time_groups, # (optional) - Grouping variable for multiple TIME series, only.
              # maxlag = NA,             # (optional) - Sets the maximum distance between pairs of observations to be inspected for autocorrelation. 
              n.sim = 500)               # Number of simulations, set to >2000 for final model assessment.

# What should I look for?
# >> Ideally, observed standardised semivariances should be WITHIN the pattern of permuted standardised 
#    semivariances extracted from the model.
# >> Autocorrelation typically shows when observed standardised semivariance falls clearly below 1 at 
#    shorter distances (= towards the left).

# Treating temporal/spatial autocorrelation? 
# >> Add an autocorrelation structure to the model formulation (see article section 5.2.2).  
# >> More detail on possible autocorrelation structures: 
#    https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glmmTMB/vignettes/covstruct.html.
